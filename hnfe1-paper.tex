\section{Introduction}

\begin{quote}{Mark Twain, 1910}
	\textit{"History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes."}
\end{quote}


\section{Development of the 1918 Flu Pandemic}

The late 1910s were marked by devastation.
The first truly global conflict, World War I, exerted a huge human toll between 1914 and 1918:
Historians estimate approximately 40 million civilian and military causalities resulting from the war \citep{royde-smithWorldWarKilled2020}.
However, a significant share of those deaths is not directly attributed to military conflict,
but to the second devastating event overlapping with the end of the military conflict and lasting at least until 1919: The 1918 flu pandemic.

Beginning in March 1918, a novel influenza virus likely emerged in mid-western parts of the United States \citep{barrySiteOrigin19182004} and spread virulently, possibly sped up by large troop movements to Europe due to World War I. It reached almost every part of the world within six months \citep{pattersonGeographyMortality19181991}.
In mainly three waves in spring 1918, fall 1918, and winter 1918/19 in the northern hemisphere, the virus infected approximately 500 million people, roughly one third of the entire world population at that time \citep{taubenberger1918InfluenzaMother2006}.
Earlier research estimated the global death toll from the virus between 21.5 \cite{jordanEpidemicInfluenzaSurvey1927} and later up to 39.3 million \citep{pattersonGeographyMortality19181991}.
More recent studies, while acknowledging the large uncertainty, account for greater under-reporting of causalities and hence estimate the global death toll between 50 and 100 million \citep{johnsonUpdatingAccountsGlobal2002}.
It is therefore reasonable to assume that the health emergency caused more causalities that the enormous toll of World War I.

While influenza outbreaks before and after the 1918 flu pandemic mainly caused worse courses of the disease and a larger death toll on the very young and older population ("U-shape"),
the outbreak in 1918 displayed an uncommon W-shape by additionally killing many otherwise healthy young adults aged 20-40 \citep{taubenberger1918InfluenzaMother2006}\footnote{
	see figures 2 and 3 in \cite{taubenberger1918InfluenzaMother2006} for detailed age profiles of incidences and causalities of the 1918 flu pandemic in comparison to the normal influenza shortly before and after.}.

Especially this ruthlessness on people in their prime working age came with significant implications for the economy.
While this section focused on the broader health consequences of the pandemic, the next part examines the economic consequences of the devastating 1918 flu pandemic.

\section{Economic Consequences of the 1918 Flu Pandemic}

By infecting one third of the world population and killing up to 100 million people, the 1918 flu pandemic not only caused grave health-related suffering, but also significantly influenced the course of the world economy.
This section first examines the economic short-term consequences arising during the pandemic, highlighting increased health care costs, higher rates of absenteeism, and the immediate negative economic effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as quarantines and temporary business shutdowns.
In subsection \ref{sec:medlong}, attention turns to the medium- to long-term economic effects including the development of economic indicators such as interest rates, wages, and asset prices. 
Further, it discusses loss of life and a potential negative impact on fetal health as factors adversely affecting the long-term economic course.


\subsection{Short-term: During the Outbreak in 1918--19}

In absence of medical tools to end the outbreak such as vaccines or an effective treatment, one of the only options  immediately available to slow the spread are non-pharmaceutical interventions, including quarantines and mandatory social distancing rules \citep{aledortNonpharmaceuticalPublicHealth2007}.
Isolating the effect of NPIs on health outcomes has been and continues to be a challenge in the medical literature:
As one of the first studies attempting to establish causality from the 1918 flu pandemic, \cite{markelNonpharmaceuticalInterventionsImplemented2007} claim that US cities with early and continuous NPI measures overall had better health outcomes.
In a direct reply, \cite{barryCommentsNonpharmaceuticalInterventions2007}, one of the leading scholars on the 1918 flu pandemic\footnote{\cite{barryGreatInfluenzaEpic2005} is considered to be one of the most extensive and complete historical accounts of the 1918 flu pandemic.}, questions the methodology of the study.
While he does not per se challenge the notion that NPIs might have had a positive effect on slowing the spread and decreasing the negative health outcomes of the pandemic, he concludes that their methodology does not fulfill scientific standards of establishing a causal relationship.
This debate exemplifies how difficult a causal statement about the usefulness of NPIs is in this case due to limited historical data\footnote{In his reply, \cite{barryCommentsNonpharmaceuticalInterventions2007} notes that there have only been three significant pandemics in the last century, making the task of establishing causality hard from a mere statistical perspective.}.

While medical literature struggles with assessing the efficacy of NPIs, Economists have used the natural experiment resulting from the exogenous pandemic shock to produce robust evidence of the 1918 flu pandemic's economic consequences in general, and NPIs in particular.
Center at this debate is a trade-off policy-makers face: NPIs result in closed businesses and less immediate economic activity, but also possibly in a less severe course of the disease, fewer deaths, and hence a quicker recovery.

Regardless of the public health aspect, no clear economic intuition is available about whether the direct economic costs outweigh the indirect economic benefits through an earlier end to the pandemic.
Addressing this question, \cite{correiaPandemicsDepressEconomy2020} used the different timing of NPI adoption in US cities in 1918--19 to isolate the economic consequences of those measures.
They show that cities with an aggressive and timely intervention in form of NPIs not only had a lower mortality rate in 1918--19, but also did not perform worse in the short-term compared to late-adopters\footnote{\cite{correiaPandemicsDepressEconomy2020} furthermore suggest that long-term economic outcomes were significantly better in cities acting early, which is further discussed in section \ref{sec:medlong}.}.

In general, pandemics are economically characterized as a simultaneous shock to both supply and demand \citep{eichenbaumMacroeconomicsEpidemics2020}.
Workers will reduce their labor supply either due to risk of infection or even by actually contracting the disease.
Simultaneously, demand decreases since consumers cannot, e.g. due to quarantines or social distancing measures, or do not want to consume goods and services, e.g. due to perceived risk of contracting the virus. While this can cause a persistent, long-term recession \citep{eichenbaumMacroeconomicsEpidemics2020}, especially the short-term labor supply shock was highly visible during the 1918 flu pandemic.

Since the prime working age population's health was severely negatively affected through the pandemic \citep{taubenberger1918InfluenzaMother2006}, industries struggled with an acute shortage of labor supply.
Absentee rates in key industries were strikingly high: According to \cite{barryPandemicsAvoidingMistakes2009}, 
shipyard workers in the United States were explicitly told that their work was as essential as a soldiers' duties, physicians were on-site, and they only received pay if present.
Nevertheless, 45\% - 58\% were absent at the peak of the pandemic in late 1918 \citep{turnerReportPreventiveMeasure}.
While this is inconclusive evidence of a general labor supply shock, it provides one of the few available data points pointing into this direction.

Due to lack of unambiguous data on the short-term effects, economists have highlighted individual anecdotal evidence through newspaper articles.
\cite{garrettEconomicEffects19182007} reviews newspapers in 1918--19 in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee, highlighting adverse effects on railway, mining and telephone service through lack of labor supply.
Additionally, this source summarizes reported negative effects on consumption, noting that local department stores and merchants saw a decrease in revenue between 40\% and 70\%.

SUMMARIZE HERE AND LEAD TO MEDIUM-TERM


\subsection{Medium- to Long-term: After the Immediate Health Thread Subsided} \label{sec:medlong}

While the short-term disruptions to the economy are described as having an overall negative, medium- and long-term consequences contrarily were both negative and positive.

\subsubsection{Negative Impact on Fetal Health}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite{almond1918InfluenzaPandemic2006}: cohorts in utero during
	the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased
	rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status,
	and higher transfer payments compared with other birth cohorts.
	
	likelihood of being poor rose as much as 15 percent
	
	Prenatal exposure to the 1918 influenza pandemic had large negative
	effects on adult economic outcomes. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Loss of Life}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite{fanInclusiveCostPandemic2016}: In this paper we use findings from that literature to generate an
	estimate of pandemic cost that is inclusive of both income loss and the cost of elevated mortality.
	
	For moderately severe pandemics about 40\% of inclusive cost results from income loss. For
	severe pandemics this fraction declines to 12\%: the intrinsic cost of elevated mortality becomes
	completely dominant.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Interest Rates, Wages, and Asset Prices}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite{correiaPandemicsDepressEconomy2020} uses variation in timing of NPIs to estimate economic effect of the pandemic. Cities with strong NPI intervention showed faster recovery and less adverse effects on the economy than comparable areas with less strong NPIs.
	\item \cite{brainerdEconomicEffects19182003}: large and robust positive effect of the influenza epidemic on per capita income growth across states during the 1920s. 
	\item \cite{karlssonImpact1918Spanish2014}: We find that the pandemic led to a significant increase in poverty rates.
	There is also relatively strong evidence that capital returns were negatively affected by the pandemic.
	 However, we find robust evidence that the influenza had no discernible effect on earnings.
	 Thisfinding is surprising since it goes against most previous empirical studies as well as theoretical predictions.
	
	\item \cite{jordaLongerrunEconomicConsequences2020}: We study rates of return on assets
	using a dataset stretching back to the 14th century, focusing on 15 major pandemics
	where more than 100,000 people died. In addition, we include major armed conflicts
	resulting in a similarly large death toll. Significant macroeconomic after-effects of the
	pandemics persist for about 40 years, with real rates of return substantially depressed.
	In contrast, we find that wars have no such effect, indeed the opposite. This is consistent
	with the destruction of capital that happens in wars, but not in pandemics. Using
	more sparse data, we find real wages somewhat elevated following pandemics. The
	findings are consistent with pandemics inducing labor scarcity and/or a shift to greater
	precautionary savings.
\end{itemize}

\section{Parallels and Differences of the 1918 Flu Pandemic and Covid-19}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Contrary to the 1918 flu pandemic, COVID-19 mostly affects the older population that is about to drop out or has already left the labor force.
	Hence, there might be no sustained negative impact on labor supply and thus no positive effect on wages.
	\item Insurance modelers developed a framework to simulate an outbreak of the 1918 flu pandemic today \citep{madhavModelingModernDay2013}. Differences in population groups affected. 1918 mostly young adults and few older, 2020 mostly older adults.	Implications for different economic consequences: Today, less adults in the phase of prime economic productivity seem die from the disease.
	\item Timing right after World War II: Economy was already in a recession, which masked the economic shock due to the pandemic.
	Contrary, Covid-19 hit the world economy during a decade-long expansion.
	Hence, the economic stakes were higher and the immediate impact on the economy more visible.
\end{itemize}
