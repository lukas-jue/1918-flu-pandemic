## Abstract

Discussions of the Covid-19-induced health and economic crises often feature
the adjective *unprecedented*. However, there exists historical precedent: The 1918
flu pandemic. By examining existing literature on its economic effects, this paper
first highlights a consensus that most indicators (GDP, consumption, poverty
rates, capital income) were worsening as a result of the 1918 flu pandemic, possibly
except for increased wages due to a labor supply shock. However, estimates
vary largely by study and evidence remains inconclusive. This paper secondly discusses
similarities and differences between the 1918 flu pandemic and Covid-19. I
conclude that a direct projection from 1918 to 2020 is difficult and economic predictions
based on the historical event might be imprecise. The main reasons are an
unusually high mortality rate in 1918â€“19 of prime working age individuals, and
vastly different economic, medical, and societal conditions.
